read</p></div><div class=content><p>This was supposed to be the post where I explained how I successfully changed the site theme to <a href=https://mmistakes.github.io>Minimal Mistakes</a>. Alas, I made two big mistakes. First, I didn&rsquo;t read the theme documentation properly. Second, I didn&rsquo;t test properly before I merged in the changes. So a lot of things broke, and this post was then supposed to detail why. Well, that didn&rsquo;t happen either.</p><p>I was in such a hurry to try out another theme that I only skimmed the <a href=https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/>quickstart guide</a>. I added <code>jekyll-include-cache</code> to my <code>Gemfile</code> and to the <code>plugins</code> array. And&mldr; and then I even forgot to take notes of what I was doing. Now I can&rsquo;t even remember what the &ldquo;branches&rdquo; bit in the title was supposed to be about. So everything is sort of a mess, and I will have to decide whether to take a backup of my posts and start all afresh or to piece it all back together bit by bit.</p><p>Needless to say, this post was not posted right before christmas either. As I mention last time, my laptop acted up. And this post was on it. And I just about gave up on all of this. But hey, the pandemic tightened its grip over the holidays, and just kept squeezing. Figuring it&rsquo;s this or banging my head through the walls, I picked up sort of where I left off.</p><p>Next post will be about fixing stuff or breaking stuff and maybe even be coherent and a bit detailed in stead of just a rambling rant.</p><p>Merry christmas to you, whenever you are!</p></div></div></article><div class=blog__navigate><div class=blog__navigateButtons><div class=blog__navigateButtons__older><a href=https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/cross-platform-blorging/>← Previous Post: Cross platform blorging</a></div><div class=blog__navigateButtons__newer><a href=https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/theme-upgrade/>Next Post: Theme upgrade (more of a repair, really) →</a></div></div></div></section></div></div><footer><div id=footer-content>© <a href=https://github.com/StatusHat>StatusHat</a> 2020 &ndash; 2022</div></footer></body></html></div></body></html>
