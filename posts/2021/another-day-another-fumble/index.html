read</p></div><div class=content><p>Last time I had a short TODO-list at the end of my post. How many have I managed to tick off?</p><ol><li>Add pages for posts by year, category and tags</li></ol><p>The &ldquo;Posts by year&rdquo; bit is embarrassing, because I can&rsquo;t remember how I ended up finding the solution. I think I ended up reading the sources of several blogs that had the features I was aiming for and trying things at random. This bothers me, because I don&rsquo;t really understand how it works.</p><p>The file I needed to edit was <code>_data/navigation.yml</code>:</p><pre><code>main:
- title: &quot;Posts&quot;
    url: /posts/
- title: &quot;Tags&quot;
    url: /tags/
- title: &quot;About&quot;
    url: /about/
</code></pre><p>As far as I can see, there is no place to define the behavior of the &ldquo;Posts&rdquo; page. Add it to &ldquo;Navigation&rdquo; and go. I may be mistaken.</p><p>On my todo-list there is also:</p><ol><li><p>Figure out what’s up with the apostrophes around the file name for the “branches and breakage” post in the output of ls _posts command earlier</p><ul><li>This was actually really simple. Some time ago, the age old command <code>ls</code> was updated with a feature to improve visibility of the output. The apostrophes are there to tell you that &ldquo;this is a file and it has spaces in it&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li><p>Read slowly and carefully</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;m not there yet&mldr;</li></ul></li><li><p>Take notes ALL the time, both while reading and of every change and command. Maybe I’ll finally learn something. Or at least finally learn…</p><ul><li>no not there either</li></ul></li><li><p>Don’t use the IDE (VS Code) for things that can be done on the command line before</p><ul><li>you know how those things work</li><li>you know how the IDE works</li></ul></li><li><p>And maybe also get vim (neovim, actually) working as editor in VS Code. Or take a pause from VS Code and just use vim for a while. Those things might also be the subject for upcoming posts.</p><ul><li>I have installed the Neo Vim plugin, and so far I&rsquo;m pleased. There are som quirks to get to know, but then I&rsquo;m not that fluent in vi-like editing yet, anyway&mldr;</li></ul></li><li><p>Also: Increase the post width. It&rsquo;s cramped</p><ul><li><p>Fixed here: index.html</p><p>Also: explain how?
Yes! Add the following line:</p><p><code>classes:wide</code></p></li></ul></li></ol><p>Things I also learned:</p><ul><li><p>Non-commited changes can be commited from any branch. Well at least non-added changes. Need to check again. Just make sure you check branch status before committing</p></li><li><p>Jekyll can keep a &ldquo;draft post&rdquo; folder. Handy! Create folder _drafts and stuff your drafts and work in progress there. To test, serve your site with the &ndash;drafts flag.</p></li><li><p>Version requirements and rolling releases are a bitch. Arch is currently at 3.0.0, but github.io (or the version of Jekyll supported by GitHub) does not yet support it. How did I solve this? That is a story for the next post.</p></li></ul></div></div></article><div class=blog__navigate><div class=blog__navigateButtons><div class=blog__navigateButtons__older><a href=https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/theme-upgrade/>← Previous Post: Theme upgrade (more of a repair, really)</a></div><div class=blog__navigateButtons__newer><a href=https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/dockerify/>Next Post: Dockerify the thing →</a></div></div></div></section></div></div><footer><div id=footer-content>© <a href=https://github.com/StatusHat>StatusHat</a> 2020 &ndash; 2025</div></footer></body></html></div></body></html>
