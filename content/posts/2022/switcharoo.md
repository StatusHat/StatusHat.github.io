I finally gave up grappling with Ruby versions, Jekyll versions and containers and stuff. After a pleasant test drive with the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io), I decided to take a big leap and switch over. I also decided to start as barebones as possible, making my own theme as I go. Hopefully I'll expose myself to lots of fun learning opportunities.
