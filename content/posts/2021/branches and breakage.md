This was supposed to be the post where I explained how I successfully changed the site theme to [Minimal Mistakes][1]. Alas, I made two big mistakes. First, I didn't read the theme documentation properly. Second, I didn't test properly before I merged in the changes. So a lot of things broke, and this post was then supposed to detail why. Well, that didn't happen either.

I was in such a hurry to try out another theme that I only skimmed the [quickstart guide][2]. I added `jekyll-include-cache` to my `Gemfile` and to the `plugins` array. And... and then I even forgot to take notes of what I was doing. Now I can't even remember what the "branches" bit in the title was supposed to be about. So everything is sort of a mess, and I will have to decide whether to take a backup of my posts and start all afresh or to piece it all back together bit by bit.

Needless to say, this post was not posted right before christmas either. As I mention last time, my laptop acted up. And this post was on it. And I just about gave up on all of this. But hey, the pandemic tightened its grip over the holidays, and just kept squeezing. Figuring it's this or banging my head through the walls, I picked up sort of where I left off.

Next post will be about fixing stuff or breaking stuff and maybe even be coherent and a bit detailed in stead of just a rambling rant.

Merry christmas to you, whenever you are!
