After a pleasant test drive with the Hugo static site generator, I decided to take a big leap and switch over. I also decided to start as barebones as possible, making my own theme as I go. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll expose myself to lots of fun learning opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Branches and breakage</title><link>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/branches-and-breakage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/branches-and-breakage/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was supposed to be the post where I explained how I successfully changed the site theme to &lt;a href="https://mmistakes.github.io">Minimal Mistakes&lt;/a>. Alas, I made two big mistakes. First, I didn&amp;rsquo;t read the theme documentation properly. Second, I didn&amp;rsquo;t test properly before I merged in the changes. So a lot of things broke, and this post was then supposed to detail why. Well, that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen either.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cross platform blorging</title><link>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/cross-platform-blorging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/cross-platform-blorging/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I set up VS Code and Git on the old Windows workstation. It boots faster than I can adjust my chair, so my hope is this will work great as a blorgomat for typing out and publishing in a flash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Theme change and wreckage</title><link>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2020/new-theme/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2020/new-theme/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out a new theme.

I keep falling down some wiki rabbithole or being distracted by some maybe cool thing to try, and ending up getting nothing done.
