After a pleasant test drive with the Hugo static site generator, I decided to take a big leap and switch over. I also decided to start as barebones as possible, making my own theme as I go. Hopefully I’ll expose myself to lots of fun learning opportunities.</div></article><article><div><h3 class=title><a href=/posts/2021/dockerify/>Dockerify the thing</a></h3><div class=blog__info><time>November 11, 2021</time> | 2 minutes
