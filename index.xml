Or try to, at least. I followed &lt;a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/">the guide&lt;/a> more closely this time, and did things a tiny bit more slowly.

Alas, I made two big mistakes. First, I didn&amp;rsquo;t read the theme documentation properly. Second, I didn&amp;rsquo;t test properly before I merged in the changes. So a lot of things broke, and this post was then supposed to detail why. Well, that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen either.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cross platform blorging</title><link>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/cross-platform-blorging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://statushat.github.io/posts/2021/cross-platform-blorging/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I set up VS Code and Git on the old Windows workstation.

This is me following tutorials, trying things, breaking things, abandoning ship, reappearing in a shiny new dinghy and trying again.
First, back in november 2020, I followed the steps over at guides.github.com and got a simple blog up and running. I wanted to be able to make changes and test locally, so I followed this guide for setting up Jekyll and this guide to setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll.</description></item></channel></rss>
