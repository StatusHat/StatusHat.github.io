I'm just figuring stuff out. It's working out OK, I guess.

This is currently very simple and sort of boring. Mostly exactly like the tutorials told me to do things.

First I followed the steps over at [guides.github.com](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) and got a simple blog up and running. I wanted to be able to make changes
and test locally, so I followed [this guide for setting up Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [this guide to setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). I got confused at some point, and ended up cleaning out the
whole repo and just creating a new one with jekyll.

Now I'm learning how all the bits and pieces work and documenting it all as I go.
