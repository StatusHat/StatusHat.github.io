It&rsquo;s working out OK, I guess.</p><p>This is me following tutorials, trying things, breaking things, abandoning ship, reappearing in a shiny new dinghy and trying again.</p><p>First, back in november 2020, I followed the steps over at <a href=https://guides.github.com/features/pages/>guides.github.com</a> and got a simple blog up and running. I wanted to be able to make changes and test locally, so I followed <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/docs/>this guide for setting up Jekyll</a> and <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll>this guide to setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll</a>. I got confused at some point, and ended up cleaning out the whole repo and just creating a new one with jekyll.</p><p>Things started making some sense, I managed to get everything working and found a beautiful theme called Minimal Mistakes which I managed to bend to my will. All seemed good for a short time. Then something got updated somewhere and I suddenly crashed hard on version dependencies. Host system (Arch linux), Ruby, Jekyll and GitHub all colluding to make things difficult. I gave up for almost a year.</p><p>When I picked things back up, nothing seemed to have changed. Dependencies were still a problem. I scanned my old posts and I saw that I had considered Hugo, which apparently rapidly gaining ground as the most popular static site generator. I tried importing the old blog from Jekyll to Hugo, tried on a few themes, and even though I ran into problems with looks and functionality it all seemed to click. I didn&rsquo;t understand how the themes worked or how to customize them, though. Even so, things seemed simpler: local testing with on the fly rendering of changes, great docs, decent file structure, Go instead of Ruby&mldr;</p><p>So here we are, mid to late 2022, trying to move to a new platform, keeping the old posts alive and <em>building a theme from scratch</em>. This might mean you will see more html/css/js-stuff here, but it will most probably just be posts about making things not break.</p><p>All the time, learning how all the bits and pieces work and documenting it all as I go. Though the documenting part needs some work.</p><h3 id=powered-by->Powered by :</h3><ul><li><a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></li><li><a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a></li></ul></div></div></article></section></div><footer><hr>Â© <a href=https://github.com/StatusHat>StatusHat</a> 2020 &ndash; 2022</footer></body></html></body></html>
