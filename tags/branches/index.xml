Alas, I made two big mistakes. First, I didn&amp;rsquo;t read the theme documentation properly. Second, I didn&amp;rsquo;t test properly before I merged in the changes. So a lot of things broke, and this post was then supposed to detail why. Well, that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen either.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
